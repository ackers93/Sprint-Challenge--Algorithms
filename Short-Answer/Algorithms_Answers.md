#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) as it increases linearly to n

b) 0(n2) due to nested iteration.

c) O(n) as it's results are linearly related to it's input.

## Exercise II

This would be a binary search, say if I had a 50 storey building, I would start at the middle floor (50) and see if the egg breaks from there, if it does, that means I can try again at floor 25, and if it survives I start at floor 38... etc.. with each step we are halving the number of floors to check. making the time complexity O(log n)
